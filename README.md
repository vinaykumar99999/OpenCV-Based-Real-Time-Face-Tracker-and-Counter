# Real-Time Face Detection and Counter

This is a web application built with Python, OpenCV, and Streamlit that performs real-time face detection and counting using a live webcam feed.

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://YOUR_APP_URL_HERE.streamlit.app/)

## üöÄ Features

-   **Real-Time Detection**: Detects multiple faces from a live webcam stream.
-   **Face Counting**: Displays a live count of the number of faces detected in the frame.
-   **Confidence Score**: Shows the confidence level for each detected face.
-   **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use web interface.
-   **Adjustable Threshold**: Allows users to adjust the detection confidence threshold in real-time.
