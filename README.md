Real-Time Face Detection and Counter
This is a web application built with Python, OpenCV, and Streamlit that performs real-time face detection and counting using a live webcam feed.

üöÄ Features
Real-Time Detection: Detects multiple faces from a live webcam stream.

Face Counting: Displays a live count of the number of faces detected in the frame.

Confidence Score: Shows the confidence level for each detected face.

Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use web interface.

Adjustable Threshold: Allows users to adjust the detection confidence threshold in real-time.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Run Locally
